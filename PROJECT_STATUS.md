## 🎯 **AI PATTERN: Structured Multi-Agent Iterative Debate**

### **Core Innovation:**
- **Multi-agent role specialization** with anti-sycophancy
- **Iterative state evolution** through persistent JSON context
- **Schema-enforced structure** for consistency
- **Final synthesis layer** for actionable outcomes
- **Profile-aware personalization** throughout the process

### **Execution Flow:**
```
1. User submits problem + profile
2. For each loop (1 to N):
   a. Optimist: Generate bold proposals
   b. Skeptic: Critique with evidence
   c. Mediator: Synthesize with trade-offs
   d. Update persistent state
3. Strategic Advisor: Final synthesis
4. Return: Process + actionable outcomes
```
